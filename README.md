# PythonProject

For this project, we assumed the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. Our job was to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data we visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we worked with were Tesla and GameStop.
